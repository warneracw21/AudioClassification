# Audio Decomposition and Classification Architecture
## Goals of this Repository
* Implement preprocessing methods from TensorFlow's tf.contrib.signal library
* Provide a foundation for decomposing audio samples into a neural network ready structure
* Design an abstracted architecture for implementing the network from Google's VGGish network
